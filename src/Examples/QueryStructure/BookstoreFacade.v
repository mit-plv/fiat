(* Our bookstore has two relations (tables):
   - The [Books] relation contains the books in the
     inventory, represented as a tuple with
     [Author], [Title], and [ISBN] attributes.
     The [ISBN] attribute is a key for the relation,
     specified by the [where attributes .. depend on ..]
     constraint.
   - The [Orders] relation contains the orders that
     have been placed, represented as a tuple with the
     [ISBN] and [Date] attributes.

   The schema for the entire query structure specifies that
   the [ISBN] attribute of [Orders] is a foreign key into
   [Books], specified by the [attribute .. of .. references ..]
   constraint.
